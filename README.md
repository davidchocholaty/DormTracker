# Dorm Tracker
This app serves to record information about the number of clothing items in the wardrobe in student dormitories. The main purpose is to ensure that you don’t find yourself in the middle of the week realizing you forgot to pack enough shorts from home (any resemblance to persons or circumstances is purely coincidental 😅).

You can easily manage by first adding dorms, then specifying the places within each dorm, and finally organizing the items and their counts in those places. This structure makes it simple to keep track of your personal belongings across different locations within the dorms.
